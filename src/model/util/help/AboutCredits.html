        <h1>About this program</h1>
        
        <p>This program support the zero-player game Game Of Life which is a cellular
        automaton. Each and every cell live by these rules.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This is a great program.</p>
