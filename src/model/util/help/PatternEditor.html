            You can use the pattern editor to view twenty generations of a created
            pattern in the strip view. If you then click the Save And Close button, the pattern
            you created in this editor will show in the main view.
        </p>

            From the pattern editor you can also save the pattern as an animated GIF
            file. Another cool thing is that pattern can be saved as a WAV file, and 
            you can enjoy listening to a musical representation of your pattern.
            You can also save the pattern with meta data.
