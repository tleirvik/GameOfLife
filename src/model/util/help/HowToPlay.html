    <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>On startup the application creates a new, dynamic board.
           You can immediately begin populating the board with cells by clicking
           on it or by clicking and dragging. Clicking on a dead cell will switch 
           it's state to 'alive', while clicking on it again will 'kill' it.</p>

            You can also load files that contains patterns made by others. It is
            also possible to save your pattern to a file.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When pressing the play button the program will start animating your 
            pattern, that is, if you have created one. You can the drag the slider
            to alter the speed of animation.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Fit To View button will fit the board to the center of the screen.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Turn Off Grid checkbox will either show or remove the gridlines.
            If the board is over 500 rows and 500 columns the gridlines will
            be turned off.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When a dynamic board is selected you can click outside the board
            and the board will automatically expand to the destination of the click.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can also edit the meta data of your board.
        </p>
        <h2>Patterns</h2>
        You have the ability to save discovered patterns to a file(RLE, Life105 or Life106 format), an animated GIF or
        to a sound(Very experimental and Arne Nordheim-ishy sounds!)
