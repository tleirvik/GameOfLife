        <h1>How To Play</h1>
        <p>On startup the application creates a new, dynamic board.
           You can immediately begin populating the board with cells by clicking
           on it or by clicking and dragging. Clicking on a dead cell will switch 
           it's state to 'alive', while clicking on it again will 'kill' it.</p>
        <p>This is a great program</p>
