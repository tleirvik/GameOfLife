        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The game has been developed as a student assignment in DATS1600(Program Development)</p>
        <p>and has been in development from the start of January 2016 until 6th of May 2016</p>
        <br/>
        <p>This program was written by Terje Leirvik, Robin Sean Aron David

        <h2>Game Of Life</h2>

        Game Of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's
        a zero-player game. The games initial state determines the evolution of the game, thus needing no input from
        a player.
        You play by creating an initial configuration(Although you can alter the game board once it's started) and
        observe its evolution.
        <h3>The game rules</h3>
        <p>
            The game board is a two-dimensional grid of cells. Each cell can either be <em>dead</em> or <em>alive</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.</li>

        </ul>
